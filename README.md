## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Google Fonts (as requested by the style guide)


### What I learned

There are some things I learned from this and I want to go and give it a try with bootstrap as this was made with vanilla html and css, but in the bootcamp i'm attending at this moment, the front-end module we did we worked with html / bootstrap, css and js.

### Useful resources

- [Example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BBYPntB-GY) - I was having some difficulties with some things I forgot and getting the margin and padding right so I watched this video as reference.
